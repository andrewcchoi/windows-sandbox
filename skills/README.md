# Claude Code Sandbox Skills

This directory contains specialized skills for setting up, securing, and troubleshooting Claude Code sandbox environments. Each skill provides structured workflows and best practices for common sandbox operations.

### File Descriptions

**SKILL.md**
- Skill metadata (name, description)
- When to use the skill
- Step-by-step workflow
- Decision trees and conditionals
- Verification steps
- Error handling

**references/** (optional)
- Supplementary documentation
- Detailed guides
- Reference tables
- Best practices
- Advanced topics

## How Skills Work

### Invocation via Commands

Skills are typically invoked through slash commands defined in `/commands/`:

```bash
# Setup commands (choose mode interactively)
/sandbox:setup

# Troubleshooting
/sandbox:troubleshoot

# Security audit
/sandbox:audit
```

See [Commands README](../commands/README.md) for full command list.

### Direct Skill Usage

Claude can also invoke skills directly when appropriate:

```
User: "I'm getting a connection refused error from PostgreSQL"
Claude: [Automatically uses sandbox-troubleshoot skill]

User: "Set up a secure development environment"
Claude: [Automatically uses sandbox-setup-advanced skill]
```

### Skill Workflow

1. **Skill Loaded**: Claude reads SKILL.md and reference documentation
2. **Context Gathered**: Claude asks questions or examines project
3. **Workflow Executed**: Claude follows structured steps in SKILL.md
4. **Validation**: Claude verifies successful completion
5. **Documentation**: Claude provides next steps and references

## Skill Comparison
