# Documentation Cleanup for v2.2.0

## Summary

Comprehensive documentation cleanup addressing inconsistencies, broken links, missing files, outdated references, and terminology issues identified in the repository.

## Changes Implemented

### Phase 1: Created Missing Documentation Files (5 files)

- ✅ **docs/security-model.md** (20KB) - Comprehensive security model documentation covering container isolation, network firewall modes, threat model, and best practices
- ✅ **docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md** (21KB) - Detailed troubleshooting guide for container, network, service connectivity, firewall, and permission issues
- ✅ **skills/README.md** (11KB) - Index of all 6 skills with descriptions, directory structure, and usage guides
- ✅ **commands/README.md** (11KB) - Index of all 7 commands with usage examples and quick reference
- ✅ **templates/README.md** (21KB) - Template system documentation covering master templates, language-specific Dockerfiles, and mode-specific configurations

### Phase 2: Fixed Broken Cross-References (8+ links)

- ✅ Example README links to security-model.md (4 files) - Now functional
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md link to skills/README.md - Now functional
- ✅ examples/README.md links:
  - Fixed TROUBLESHOOTING.md reference (proper markdown link)
  - Changed SECURITY.md reference to security-model.md
- ✅ README.md skill references path - Verified correct

### Phase 3: Fixed Outdated References (6 instances)

- ✅ **CONTRIBUTING.md**:
  - Removed TODO markers for existing skills (sandbox-troubleshoot, sandbox-security)
  - Fixed `basic-streamlit` → `streamlit-sandbox-basic` (3 occurrences)
  - Added Intermediate mode to examples list
- ✅ **README.md**: Added missing `demo-app-sandbox-intermediate/` to examples structure
- ✅ **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Fixed `basic-streamlit` → `streamlit-sandbox-basic`
- ✅ **streamlit-sandbox-basic/README.md**: Added Intermediate mode to comparison section
- ✅ **tests/README.md**: Verified correct (already uses `test-setup-yolo.md`)

### Phase 4: Fixed Terminology Inconsistencies (4 occurrences)

- ✅ **templates/legacy/README.md**:
  - "three-tier system" → "three-mode system"
  - "per tier requirements" → "per mode requirements"
  - "YOLO tier" → "YOLO mode"
- ✅ Verified no remaining "Pro" terminology (only in archived docs)

### Phase 5: Consolidation Recommendations (Future Work)

- ✅ **docs/CONSOLIDATION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md** - Created comprehensive consolidation recommendations document for v2.3.0+
  - README.md consolidation opportunities
  - VARIABLES.md and SECRETS.md overlap analysis
  - Mode comparison table duplication discussion

## Impact

### Before

- TODO markers for completed features

### After
- All critical documentation complete and accessible
- All cross-references functional
- Consistent naming throughout repository
- Unified terminology (mode, not tier)
- Clear status of all features
