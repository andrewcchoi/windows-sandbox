[15-20+ questions with full customization options...]

Claude: Base image source?
        • Official Docker (python, node, etc.)
        • Docker sandbox-templates (latest, claude-code, nightly)
        • Custom registry (specify full path)
        • Local Dockerfile (you provide)

You: sandbox-templates

Claude: sandbox-templates tag?
        • latest (stable)
        • claude-code (optimized)
        • nightly (unstable, latest features)
        • 0.1.0-alpha.1 (specific alpha)
        • cagent (agent-focused)
        • Custom tag

You: nightly

Claude: Firewall?
        • Disabled (allow all traffic)
        • Custom whitelist (you provide domains)
        • Strict (minimal whitelist, you'll add more)
        • Expanded (full whitelist)

You: Disabled
```

**What You Get**:
- **Base Image**: Anything:
  - `docker/sandbox-templates:nightly`
  - `docker/sandbox-templates:cagent`
  - Custom registries (internal, experimental)
  - Your own Dockerfile
- **Dockerfile**: You choose:
  - Use template as-is
  - Multi-stage custom
  - Your own from scratch
- **Services**: Any combination, any versions
- **VS Code Extensions**: Full control (or none)
- **Firewall**:
  - Can disable completely
  - Can use empty whitelist
  - Can provide custom domain list
  - Can mix mode defaults with custom
- **Network Mode**: Your choice
- **Questions**: As many as needed for full customization

**What's Different**:
- Access to experimental/nightly images
- Can disable safety features
- Can use non-standard configurations
- Can test unreleased features
- Full control over every aspect

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Testing Nightly Features**:
   ```
   Base: docker/sandbox-templates:nightly
   Firewall: Disabled (testing needs full access)
   Extensions: Minimal (testing environment itself)
   ```

2. **Custom Internal Setup**:
   ```
   Base: internal-registry.company.com/dev:latest
   Firewall: Custom corporate whitelist
   Extensions: Company-standard set
   Services: Internal auth + custom DB
   ```

3. **Research Environment**:
   ```
   Base: docker/sandbox-templates:gemini
   Firewall: Disabled (need full internet access)
   Extensions: Full AI tooling
   Services: Ollama + ChromaDB + PostgreSQL
   ```

4. **Minimalist Setup**:
   ```
   Base: alpine:latest
   Firewall: Strict minimal (5 domains)
   Extensions: None
   Services: None
   ```

**Risks and Warnings**:
- Nightly images may be unstable
- Disabled firewall exposes to internet
- Experimental features may break
- No security guarantees
- You're responsible for hardening
- May not work with future plugin versions

**When to Use YOLO**:
- You have specific requirements none of the other modes meet
- You're testing experimental features
- You need to disable safety features temporarily
- You're an expert and know the risks
- You're doing research requiring unusual configurations

**When NOT to Use YOLO**:
- Production environments (use Advanced instead)
- Sensitive data (use Advanced instead)
- Team projects (use Intermediate instead)
- Learning projects (use Basic instead)
- When you're unsure (use Intermediate instead)

- Tutorial likely uses PostgreSQL
- Don't want to spend time on DevContainer config
- Need it working quickly
- Will throw away after learning

**Setup**:
```bash
/sandbox:basic
# Auto-detects Python + FastAPI
# Creates PostgreSQL + Redis
# Ready in 90 seconds
```

---

### Use Case 2: Startup Building MVP

**Scenario**: 3-person team, React + Node.js + MongoDB, iterating fast.

**Recommended Mode**: **Intermediate**

**Rationale**:
- Team needs consistent environment
- Want MongoDB (not PostgreSQL default)
- Need to pin Node version (team standardization)
- May need AWS access later
- Not ready for production yet

**Setup**:
```bash
/sandbox:intermediate
# Choose: Node.js 20
# Choose: MongoDB
# Choose: Expanded firewall (for AWS)
# Share config with team
```

---

### Use Case 3: SaaS Company Production App

**Scenario**: Existing app, preparing for SOC2 audit, handling customer data.

**Recommended Mode**: **Advanced**

**Rationale**:
- Security is critical (customer data)
- Need audit trail
- Must document security measures
- Production deployment soon
- Compliance requirements

**Setup**:
```bash
/sandbox:advanced
# Answer security questions
# Review firewall whitelist
# Document choices for audit
# Use in staging and production
```

---

### Use Case 4: Research Project Testing AI Models

**Scenario**: PhD student testing Ollama + custom embeddings + experimental features.

**Recommended Mode**: **YOLO**

**Rationale**:
- Need Ollama (not in standard templates)
- Want nightly builds for latest features
- Need to download models (firewall would block)
- Experimental setup
- Solo project (no team coordination)

**Setup**:
```bash
/sandbox:yolo
# Base: docker/sandbox-templates:gemini
# Firewall: Disabled
# Services: Ollama + ChromaDB + PostgreSQL
# Extensions: Custom AI tooling
```

---

### Use Case 5: Open Source Python Library

**Scenario**: Public GitHub repo, accepting contributions, running CI/CD.

**Recommended Mode**: **Intermediate** or **Advanced**

**Rationale**:
- Contributors need easy setup (Intermediate)
- But security matters for trust (Advanced)
- Compromise: Start Intermediate, offer Advanced

**Setup**:
```bash
# In README.md
## Development Setup

### Quick Start (Recommended for Contributors)
/sandbox:intermediate

### Security-Focused Setup (For Maintainers)
/sandbox:advanced
```

---

### Use Case 6: Corporate Internal Tool

**Scenario**: Internal Python tool, custom corporate registry, specific compliance requirements.

**Recommended Mode**: **YOLO**

**Rationale**:
- Must use corporate registry
- Has specific firewall rules (corporate domains)
- Unique requirements don't fit modes
- Expert team maintaining it

**Setup**:
```bash
/sandbox:yolo
# Base: internal.company.com/python-dev:latest
# Firewall: Custom corporate whitelist
# Extensions: Company-standard set
# Document as company template
```

---

## Mode Migration Paths

### Upgrading: Basic → Intermediate

**When**: Project grows, need more control

**Steps**:
1. Note your current config (PostgreSQL version, etc.)
2. Run `/sandbox:intermediate`
3. Choose same services but with version control
4. Migrate data from old volumes to new
5. Test thoroughly

**Migration Time**: 30-60 minutes

---

### Upgrading: Intermediate → Advanced

**When**: Preparing for production, security review

**Steps**:
1. Audit current setup (what's actually needed?)
2. Document security requirements
3. Run `/sandbox:advanced`
4. Review firewall whitelist (add project-specific domains)
5. Test with strict firewall (may need iterations)
6. Update CI/CD to use new config
7. Document security measures

**Migration Time**: 4-8 hours (includes testing and documentation)

---

### Upgrading: Basic → Advanced

**When**: Prototype → Production, skipping intermediate

**Steps**:
1. List all current functionality
2. Document data that must be preserved
3. Review security requirements
4. Run `/sandbox:advanced`
5. Methodically test each feature (firewall may block)
6. Add domains as needed (one by one, document each)
7. Performance test
8. Security audit

**Migration Time**: 8-16 hours (big jump)

---

### Lateral Move: Any → YOLO

**When**: Standard modes don't meet unique requirements

**Steps**:
1. Export current config
2. Document what works and what doesn't
3. List exact customizations needed
4. Run `/sandbox:yolo`
5. Replicate working config
6. Add customizations
7. Extensive testing
8. Document everything (no defaults to rely on)

**Migration Time**: 2-4 hours (just configuration)

---

## FAQ

### Q: Can I start with YOLO and move to Advanced later?

**A**: Yes, but it's usually easier to go the other way. YOLO gives you complete freedom, which means you might configure things in non-standard ways. Moving to Advanced means fitting into a more opinionated structure. Better to start with Advanced and move to YOLO if you need more flexibility.

### Q: Why would I use Basic over Intermediate?

**A**: Speed. If you're prototyping or learning and the defaults work for you, Basic gets you running in under 2 minutes. Intermediate asks 5-8 questions which slows you down. Use Basic when you want to focus on your app, not the environment.

### Q: Is Advanced mode actually "production-ready"?

**A**: It's production-ready from a security standpoint, but you still need:
- Proper secrets management (not in docker-compose.yml)
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup strategy
- Scaling configuration
- Load balancing

Advanced mode gives you a secure foundation, not a complete production system.

### Q: What if I need a service not in the mode?

**A**:
- **Basic**: You can manually add to docker-compose.yml after generation
- **Intermediate**: Choose "Custom" when asked about services
- **Advanced**: You'll be asked about each service specifically
- **YOLO**: Full control, add anything

### Q: Can I mix mode features?

**A**: Not directly through the plugin, but you can:
1. Generate config in one mode
2. Manually copy features from another mode's example
3. Use YOLO mode and manually implement what you want

### Q: How do I add a firewall domain after setup?

**A**: Edit `.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh`:
```bash
# Find the section with iptables rules
iptables -A OUTPUT -d example.com -j ACCEPT
```

Then rebuild container: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

### Q: Which mode for Kubernetes development?

**A**: **Intermediate** (includes k8s.io domains) or **Advanced** (if you want minimal and will add k8s domains explicitly).

### Q: Which mode for GitHub Actions?

**A**: **Intermediate** or **Advanced**. Both work with CI/CD. Use Intermediate for convenience, Advanced for security-critical projects.

### Q: Can I change modes without losing data?

**A**: Yes, use Docker volumes:
1. Note volume names from current `docker-compose.yml`
2. Generate new config in different mode
3. Update new `docker-compose.yml` to use same volume names
4. Data persists across mode changes

### Q: What's the difference between Advanced and YOLO for security?

**A**:
- **Advanced**: Opinionated security (we choose hardening measures)
- **YOLO**: You choose everything (can be more secure if you know what you're doing, or less secure if you don't)

For most users wanting security: Use Advanced.
