# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [4.4.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- **Multi-Stack Selection**: Users can now select multiple tools to build full stacks
  - Example: Python + Node (base) + Go (backend) + PostgreSQL tools
  - Solves AskUserQuestion 4-option limit with category-based flow
  - "Add more tools?" loop enables building complete development stacks

### Changed
- **commands/setup.md**: Complete rewrite of question flow
  - Step 1: Initialize `SELECTED_PARTIALS` array
  - Step 2-6: Category selection with loop-back logic
    - Backend languages: Go, Rust, Java, Ruby (via "More languages..."), PHP
    - Database tools: PostgreSQL client + extensions
    - C++ development: Clang 17 or GCC (mutually exclusive)
  - Step 10: Build Dockerfile now loops over all selected partials
  - Step 13: Report shows complete stack summary
- **skills/_shared/templates/partials/postgres.dockerfile**:
  - Removed duplicate `PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE` ENV definitions
  - Base dockerfile already defines these values
  - Added comment explaining why ENVs are not redefined

### Technical Details
- New question flow supports:
  - Multi-select: Choose Go + PostgreSQL + C++ in one session
  - Overflow handling: "More languages..." for Ruby/PHP (4-option limit)
  - Mutual exclusion: C++ Clang vs GCC handled by single-select question
- Partial composition:
  - All partials use `USER root` → `USER node` pattern
  - Safely composable (no USER command conflicts)
  - PATH extensions use `$PATH:...` pattern (no conflicts)
- ENV conflict resolution:
  - Postgres partial no longer redefines PGHOST/PGUSER/PGDATABASE
  - Uses base values: `sandboxxer_user` / `sandboxxer_dev`

### Benefits
- Users can build realistic multi-stack projects (frontend + backend + database)
- All 9 language options discoverable through categories
- Stays within AskUserQuestion 4-option limit
- No ENV conflicts when composing multiple partials

## [4.2.1] - 2025-12-23

### Fixed
- **Basic Mode: Template Source Correction**
  - Fixed command to use canonical templates from `skills/_shared/templates/` instead of `docs/examples/demo-app-sandbox-basic/`
  - Command now copies and processes actual templates with placeholder replacement
  - Includes required `data/allowable-domains.json` for Docker build

### Changed
- **commands/basic.md**:
  - Added plugin directory discovery (works in both installed and development environments)
  - Copies from `skills/_shared/templates/` (canonical source)
  - File mapping: `base.dockerfile` → `Dockerfile`, `init-firewall/disabled.sh` → `init-firewall.sh`
  - Uses `sed` to replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` placeholders
  - Copies `allowable-domains.json` to `data/` directory for Docker build

### Technical Details
- Plugin discovery (3 methods, in order):
  1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable (inline/development plugins)
  2. Search in `~/.claude/plugins` (installed plugins)
  3. Current directory if templates exist (fallback)
- Template processing: 5 DevContainer files + 1 data file = 6 total files
- Placeholder replacement: `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` replaced in devcontainer.json and docker-compose.yml

## [4.2.0] - 2025-12-23

### Breaking Changes
- **Basic Mode: Converted from Skill to Command**
  - Replaced `skills/devcontainer-setup-basic/` with `commands/basic.md`
  - Added `allowed-tools: [Bash]` restriction to enforce file copying at system level
  - Command now uses direct `cp -r` from reference implementation at `docs/examples/demo-app-sandbox-basic/`
  - Write tool is now **prohibited** at the system level, preventing agent from generating files

### Fixed
- **Root cause of incomplete file generation**: Both planning and default modes were using Write tool instead of copying from reference
  - Planning mode placed files correctly due to more deliberate reasoning time
  - Default mode grouped all files in `.devcontainer/` including docker-compose.yml (wrong location)
  - Solution: System-level tool restriction forces exact file copying behavior

### Changed
- **Basic mode workflow**:
  - Old: Agent reads skill, attempts to generate files via Write tool
  - New: Agent executes single bash command to copy all 5 files from reference
  - Result: Guaranteed correct files, correct locations, no interpretation needed

### Technical Details
- Command uses: `cp -r docs/examples/demo-app-sandbox-basic/.devcontainer . && cp docs/examples/demo-app-sandbox-basic/docker-compose.yml .`
- All 5 files copied: Dockerfile, devcontainer.json, init-firewall.sh, setup-claude-credentials.sh, docker-compose.yml
- docker-compose.yml placed at project root (correct Docker Compose convention)
- Scripts automatically marked executable via `chmod +x`

## [4.1.1] - 2025-12-23

### Fixed
- **Basic Mode: Enforced Bash Tool Usage**
  - Fixed issue where agent ignored skill's bash cp instructions and used Write tool instead
  - Added explicit tool restrictions prohibiting Write tool for devcontainer files
  - Made Bash command mandatory with clear directive language
  - Updated Stop hook to enforce all 5 files present (exit 2 if missing)
  - Cleaned up non-working PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks from hooks.json
  - Root cause: Agent interpreted bash code blocks as documentation rather than executable instructions

### Changed
- **devcontainer-setup-basic skill**
  - Added "TOOL RESTRICTIONS" section at top with explicit prohibitions
  - Converted multi-line bash example into single-line mandatory command
  - Added "DO NOT" list to prevent common mistakes
- **verify-devcontainer-complete.sh hook**
  - Moved script files from optional warnings to required errors
  - Changed exit behavior: exit 2 (block) on errors instead of exit 0 (informational)
  - All 5 files now mandatory: Dockerfile, devcontainer.json, docker-compose.yml, init-firewall.sh, setup-claude-credentials.sh
- **hooks.json**
  - Removed PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks (matched but never executed)
  - Kept only Stop hook which reliably executes

## [4.1.0] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed
- **Basic Mode: Direct Copy from Reference Implementation**
  - Fixed missing files issue (`init-firewall.sh`, `setup-claude-credentials.sh` were not generated)
  - Fixed wrong file locations (`docker-compose.yml` was in `.devcontainer/` instead of root)
  - Fixed incorrect configurations (wrong user, missing postStartCommand, etc.)
  - **Solution**: Basic mode now copies all 5 files directly from `docs/examples/demo-app-sandbox-basic/`
  - Benefits: Guaranteed consistency, all files present, correct configurations
  - Evaluated against requirements in Dec 2025 gap analysis

### Changed
- **devcontainer-setup-basic skill v4.1.0**
  - Replaced agent-based generation with direct file copy
  - Removed template composition complexity
  - Updated validation checks to verify reference file integrity
  - Added clear documentation about the change

## [4.0.0] - 2025-12-22

### Major Breaking Changes
- **Mandatory Planning Mode**: All devcontainer skills now require planning phase before execution
  - Scans project directory and detects configuration
  - Creates plan document in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-devcontainer-setup.md`
  - Presents plan to user for approval
  - Only implements after explicit user approval
  - Benefits: User visibility, opportunity to review, clear decision documentation

- **Intermediate Mode Deprecated**: Removed devcontainer-setup-intermediate skill
  - Analysis showed 90% of users preferred Basic (simple) or Advanced (security-focused)
  - Maintenance burden of duplicate templates eliminated
  - Users should migrate to Basic or Advanced modes
  - See `commands/intermediate.md` for migration guide

### Added
- **Shared Resources Architecture**: Consolidated templates and data
  - New `skills/_shared/` directory structure
  - `skills/_shared/planning-phase.md` - Common planning workflow
  - `skills/_shared/templates/` - Single source of truth for all templates (~45 → ~18 files)
  - `skills/_shared/data/` - Consolidated data files (moved from root `data/`)
  - `skills/_shared/templates/init-firewall/` - Three firewall variants (disabled/permissive/strict)

### Changed
- **Simplified Skills**: All SKILL.md files dramatically reduced in size
  - devcontainer-setup-basic: 1093 → 234 lines (79% reduction)
  - devcontainer-setup-advanced: 780 → 309 lines (60% reduction)
  - devcontainer-setup-yolo: 1092 → 372 lines (66% reduction)
  - Total: 2965 → 915 lines (69% average reduction)
  - Skills now reference shared resources instead of duplicating content

- **Updated Documentation**: All docs updated for v4.0.0
  - Removed intermediate mode references
  - Added planning phase documentation
  - Updated skill comparison tables
  - Updated command reference guides

- **Repository Cleanup**: Removed duplicate root directories
  - Deleted `data/` directory (exact duplicate of `skills/_shared/data/`)
  - Deleted `templates/` directory (outdated master template system)
  - Deleted `.internal/scripts/sync-templates.sh` (no longer needed)
  - Updated `skills/_shared/data/README.md` paths to reference new location
  - Rewrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for v4.0.0 shared resources architecture

### Benefits
- Single source of truth for templates (easier maintenance)
- Consistent planning workflow across all modes
- User approval before execution (no surprises)
- ~70% reduction in skill file sizes
- Eliminated template duplication

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Reorganized repository structure for better clarity
  - Moved maintenance files to `.internal/`: repo-keeper, audits, archive, plans, legacy-templates, tests, scripts, bin, hooks, node_modules
  - Moved examples to `docs/examples/`
  - Core plugin files remain at root: .claude-plugin/, agents/, commands/, data/, skills/, templates/master/

### Fixed
- **Template path discovery failure**: Fixed silent template copy failures when running from user projects
  - Root cause: Plugin directory discovery using `find ~/.claude/plugins` was unreliable
  - Solution: Reorganized templates with hybrid approach using skill-relative paths
  - Changed: Mode-specific files moved to `skills/*/templates/` for self-contained discovery
  - Changed: Shared files (Dockerfiles, compose, credentials) moved to `templates/shared/`
  - Result: Templates now work reliably regardless of execution directory
  - Updated all four skill files with simpler path discovery logic
  - Updated INVENTORY.json and ARCHITECTURE.md with new structure

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-19

### Major Breaking Changes
- **Plugin renamed**: `sandboxxer` → `devcontainer-setup`
  - All slash commands updated: `/devcontainer-setup:*` → `/devcontainer-setup:*`
  - Updated plugin.json and marketplace.json with new name
  - Clarified purpose: Creates VS Code DevContainer configurations (not Claude Code's sandbox feature)
  - Repository name remains "sandbox-maxxing" for backwards compatibility

### Added
- **Copy-first workflow**: Complete template structure redesign
  - New `/templates/output-structures/` directory with complete file hierarchies
  - Four mode-specific template directories: basic/, intermediate/, advanced/, yolo/
  - Each mode includes: Dockerfile (multi-stage), devcontainer.json, docker-compose.yml, credentials script, firewall script (where applicable)
  - Templates are copied directly, then customized with placeholders
  - Ensures complete files with all features (multi-stage builds, credentials persistence, comprehensive tooling)

### Changed
- **Workflow methodology**: From "read-and-generate" to "copy-first"
  - All four skill files updated with new copy-first workflow instructions
  - Added plugin root discovery using find commands
  - Added mandatory verification checkpoints for copied files
  - Ensures Dockerfiles have 80+ lines with multi-stage builds
- **File generation accuracy**: Fixed all four reported issues
  - ✅ Missing files - Now copies complete template structures
  - ✅ Wrong locations - Explicit file paths in copy commands
  - ✅ Minimal/incorrect content - Complete templates with all features
  - ✅ Wrong file types - Clear distinction between DevContainer and Claude Code configs
- **Descriptions updated**: All command files and README
  - Clarified "VS Code DevContainer setup" vs "sandbox setup"
  - Updated command descriptions to reflect DevContainer focus
  - Removed ambiguous references to "Claude Code sandbox"

### Fixed
- **Template reading issues**: Claude was not using template files at all
  - Root cause: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable not being resolved
  - Solution: Direct file copy operations via Bash instead of read-and-generate
- **Dockerfile requirements**: Now enforced for ALL modes
  - Basic mode: Multi-stage Dockerfile required (was previously optional)
  - All modes: 80+ line Dockerfiles with comprehensive tooling
- **Firewall configuration**: Clarified mode-specific firewall behavior
  - Basic: NO firewall script (relies on container isolation only)
  - Intermediate/Advanced/YOLO: Appropriate firewall scripts included
